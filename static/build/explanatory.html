            You are invited to take part in this study. Please read this Explanatory
            Statement in full before deciding whether or not to participate in this
            research. If you would like further information regarding any aspect of
            this project, you are encouraged to contact the researchers via the phone
            numbers or email addresses listed above.
        </p>
        <h3 id="what-does-the-research-involve" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">What does the research involve?</h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            This study is designed to study the effeteness of different mode of error message in Chameleon.
            Chameleon is a tool we develop to help programers identify and solve Haskell type errors.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            Once you navigated to the user study website, you will be prompted with 8
            different code challenges. Each code challenge is an editable code
            fragment in a web page, and a debugging area on the right side of the
            webpage to help you investigate the type errors (if there are any). For
            half of the challenges, you will be assisted by Chameleon Basic Mode,
            and Chameleon Interactive Mode for the other half. At the top of the
            webpage you will see a banner indicating exactly which debugging system
            you are using.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            After the study, you will be ask to leave an overall feedback of your
            experience in working with GHC and Chameleon debugger.
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-do-we-collect-the-data" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">How do we collect the data?</h3>
        <p class="my-2">We will collect the data in two methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Through post-study web form.</li>
            <li>
                2. Through tele-metrics during the time you working on the
                challenges. This include tracking important timings (e.g. when you
                start and complete a certain challenge), and usage patterns (e.g. how many
                time do you consult the error message before making an edit) in your web
                browser.
            </li>

            Consenting to participate in the project and withdrawing from the research
        </h3>
        <p class="my-2">The consent process includes the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the consent web page</li>
            <li>
                Read the information about the data we collect, how we collect and how
                can you stop participate

        </ul>
        <p class="my-2">
            You can choose to withdraw from further participation at any stage. To
            withdraw from this study, you simply close the user study website tab in
            the web browser. We will erase all the data associate with your session if
            you did not complete the study. Additionally, we will provide you a
            withdraw ID at the start of this study. You can email the student
            investigator (<a href="mailto:shuai.fu@monash.edu" target="_blank" class="url">shuai.fu@monash.edu</a>) with
            your withdraw ID at anytime to withdraw your data, even if you
            completed the study.

            Possible benefits and risks to participants
        </h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            There&#39;s no risks involved in participating this research. You are not
            required to be physically present. The study does not require you to
            perform physical activities or interact with physical objects. We will
            keep the study within a minimal time frame of 20 minutes to avoid strain.
            The information you will provide in the study are limited to the area of
            programming language knowledge and skill.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            The user study gives no immediate benefit to the participants, However in
            the long-term, you may benefit from the tools that we develop as part of
            the research. Broadly, this user study will help researchers to better
            understand how to design, and improve the compiler interface and
            interactive IDE.
        </p>
        <h3 id="confidentiality" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">Confidentiality</h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            We will not collect any data that can be linked to your identity, your
            device, or your location. We will use a random identifier (such as GUID)
            to group the collected data by each participant.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            All published data will remain anonymous. The collected data and
            questionnaire answers will be used in the publication.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            The members of the this project may include the user study results in
            journal articles, conference papers, or book chapters. Student
            co-investigator may include the user study result in his Ph.D. thesis.
        </p>
        <h3 id="storage-of-data" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">Storage of data</h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            The data will be stored offline-only, in an encrypted hard drive located
            in Australia. The members of the Interactive Haskell Type Inference
            Exploration project will be able to access the data. The data will be
            erased from the hard drive 12 months after it is collected.
        </p>
        <h3 id="results" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">Results</h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            The members of the Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration project
            may include the user study results in journal articles, conference papers,
            or book chapters. Student co-investigator (Shuai Fu) may include the user
            study result in his Ph.D. thesis. We will only publish summary-formed
            results. No personal data will be published. Participants may gain access
            to a pre-print electronic version of a journal article or conference paper
            after it will have been published. Participants may gain access to the
            electronic version of the student investigator’s Ph.D. thesis after it has
